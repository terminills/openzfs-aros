# Port status

Experimental development snapshot; not production-qualified storage software.

## Implemented integration

The source contains the upstream OpenZFS engine, a shared AROS library/service,
native DOS handler, management UI, upstream command-line tools, startup support,
and device adapters. The UI sends backend requests rather than simulating pool
operations. Security and MuFS integration are platform dependencies.

Historical development testing includes native file access, pool lifecycle,
file-backed multi-device pools, mirror checksum repair, unrecoverable checksum
errors, degraded RAIDZ2, and recovery/packaging checks. See the component notes
for the exact scope and restrictions of individual tests. These are prior test
results, not a fresh qualification of this public snapshot.

## Remaining boundaries

- A compatible patched AROS runtime is required; stock-nightly compatibility is
  not established for every component.
- Physical storage flush, disconnect, and abrupt power-loss behavior require
  hardware qualification. Virtual-disk tests do not establish these guarantees.
- Not every upstream feature or topology has end-to-end AROS validation.
- TRIM/discard is not implemented for AROS file or native-device backings;
  requests report unsupported rather than claiming successful discard.
- This does not provide an NFS/SMB client or server for browsing a remote ZFS
  server automatically.
- File-backed shared `mmap` is not provided by AROS; the port must use supported
  native I/O and explicit ownership rather than assume Linux memory semantics.
- Reproducible dependency bootstrap and wider independent testing remain work
  for contributors. No prebuilt binaries or test-disk images are included.

Use `ENV:` for active settings and `ENVARC:` for persistent settings. Preserve
backups outside experimental pools, and never assume compatibility with the
older private AROS ZFS on-disk format.

## Public snapshot validation, 2026-10-21

The native Manager compiled and linked from initial public source `b3ecbadd`
using an explicitly configured x86-64 SDK and matching private pthread archive.
The resulting executable SHA-256 is
`0798042fe8f867d1721d613c7a61de3711089c909d1e26849395f1fbd47e0506`.

A separate isolated hosted test using an older development runtime failed
before the Manager opened: AROS reported a bus/address-error alert in
`Exec_43_RemHead`, with a null-address trap. This is a failed compatibility test,
not successful hosted validation. The cause has not yet been isolated; do not
assume arbitrary SDK/runtime combinations are interchangeable. The earlier
qualified native package results do not establish that this combination works.

The test used a private runtime copy, no storage service, and no physical disks.
Source syntax checks covered 99 shell scripts and 16 Python files; four metadata
unit tests passed. These checks are separate from native runtime acceptance.
